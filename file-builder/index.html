    return process.stdout.decode()
</code></pre>
<p>Calling <code>FileBuilder.build</code> or <code>FileBuilder.build_versioned</code>
runs a build operation. There are two types of cacheable operations
that may occur during a build: "build file" operations, triggered by
calling <code>FileBuilder.build_file</code> or
<code>FileBuilder.build_file_with_comparison</code>, and "subbuild"
operations, triggered by calling <code>FileBuilder.subbuild</code>. Whenever
we call <code>build_file</code>, <code>build_file_with_comparison</code>, or
<code>subbuild</code>, we check whether the result is cached. If so, we use
the cached result. If not, we obtain the result by calling the
function that was supplied as an argument.</p>
<p>For this to work properly, the functions used to rebuild files or
execute subbuilds must obey certain rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>They must be functional. That is, they must depend only on their
arguments and on the contents of the file system, and they may not
have any side effects. (Irrelevant side effects like printing to
standard output or writing to a log file are permitted.)</li>
<li>They must be deterministic. For their given arguments, and given
the current contents of the file system, they must produce the
same results - or at least equivalent results from the
application's perspective.</li>
<li>All file system operations on the relevant files must be performed
by calling a <code>FileBuilder</code> method. For example, it is invalid to
call <code>os.path.isdir</code>; the function must call
<code>FileBuilder.is_dir</code> instead. This does not apply to
"irrelevant" files that we are not operating on, such as log
files, temporary files, or external binary files.</li>
<li>As a corollary, we may only read from files passed to the
<code>read_text</code>, <code>read_binary</code>, and <code>declare_read</code> methods.
Again, this does not apply to "irrelevant" files.</li>
<li>Another corollary: We may only write to a (relevant) file during a
call to <code>build_file</code> or <code>build_file_with_comparison</code> for that
file.</li>
</ul>
<p>If these restrictions are followed, then the behavior of
<code>FileBuilder.build</code> is equivalent to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove all files created during the previous build.</li>
<li>Call the function passed as an argument to <code>FileBuilder.build</code>.</li>
<li>Whenever we call <code>build_file</code>, <code>build_file_with_comparison</code>,
or <code>subbuild</code>, call the function passed as an argument.</li>
<li>If the function passed to <code>FileBuilder.build</code> doesn't raise an
exception, return that function's return value.</li>
<li>If the function passed to <code>FileBuilder.build</code> raises an
exception, roll back. That is, remove all of the files created
during the current build, and restore all of the files written
during the previous build.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even though this is what <code>FileBuilder.build</code> appears to be doing,
this is not what actually happens behind the scenes. In reality,
whenever we can use a previously cached result instead of calling a
function passed as an argument to a <code>FileBuilder</code> method, we do
so. Using a cached result is legitimate if the filename and function
name are the same, the arguments to the function are the same, the
optional version is the same, and all of the file system operations
have the same results.</p>
<p>In addition, to save time, <code>FileBuilder</code> doesn't initially delete
any of the files written during the previous build. It's possible
that many of these files won't need to be touched at all, because
their cache entries are still valid. For this and other reasons, the
results of <code>FileBuilder</code>'s file system methods, such as
<code>is_file</code> and <code>list_dir</code>, depend on the virtual state of the
file system maintained by <code>FileBuilder</code>, not simply on the real
state of the file system.</p>
<p><code>FileBuilder</code> does its best to deal with concurrent external
changes to files and directories, but it makes no guarantees.</p>
<p><code>FileBuilder</code> is thread-safe. A build process may be parallelized
using multithreading or multiprocessing. However, be aware that the

    -----

    ``FileBuilder`` is perhaps best introduced with an example. The
    ``lint_dir`` function below lints all of the Python files in a given
    directory, using the ``flake8`` command::

        import os, subprocess
        from file_builder import FileBuilder

        def lint_dir(root_dir, cache_filename):
            # Equivalent to lint_with_builder(-, root_dir)
            output = FileBuilder.build(
                cache_filename, &#39;lint_dir&#39;, lint_with_builder, root_dir)
            print(output, end=&#39;&#39;)

        def lint_with_builder(builder, root_dir):
            output = []
            for filename in python_files_in_dir(builder, root_dir):
                # Equivalent to lint_file(-, filename), but with caching
                file_output = builder.subbuild(
                    &#39;lint_file&#39;, lint_file, filename)
                output.append(file_output)
            return &#39;&#39;.join(output)

        def python_files_in_dir(builder, root_dir):
            python_files = []
            for dir_, subdirs, subfiles in builder.walk(root_dir):
                for subfile in subfiles:
                    if subfile.endswith(&#39;.py&#39;):
                        python_files.append(os.path.join(dir_, subfile))
            return python_files

        def lint_file(builder, filename):
            builder.declare_read(filename)

            # Return the output of the flake8 command
            process = subprocess.run(
                [&#39;flake8&#39;, filename], capture_output=True)
            return process.stdout.decode()

    Calling ``FileBuilder.build`` or ``FileBuilder.build_versioned``
    runs a build operation. There are two types of cacheable operations
    that may occur during a build: &#34;build file&#34; operations, triggered by
    calling ``FileBuilder.build_file`` or
    ``FileBuilder.build_file_with_comparison``, and &#34;subbuild&#34;
    operations, triggered by calling ``FileBuilder.subbuild``. Whenever
    we call ``build_file``, ``build_file_with_comparison``, or
    ``subbuild``, we check whether the result is cached. If so, we use
    the cached result. If not, we obtain the result by calling the
    function that was supplied as an argument.

    For this to work properly, the functions used to rebuild files or
    execute subbuilds must obey certain rules:

    * They must be functional. That is, they must depend only on their
      arguments and on the contents of the file system, and they may not
      have any side effects. (Irrelevant side effects like printing to
      standard output or writing to a log file are permitted.)
    * They must be deterministic. For their given arguments, and given
      the current contents of the file system, they must produce the
      same results - or at least equivalent results from the
      application&#39;s perspective.
    * All file system operations on the relevant files must be performed
      by calling a ``FileBuilder`` method. For example, it is invalid to
      call ``os.path.isdir``; the function must call
      ``FileBuilder.is_dir`` instead. This does not apply to
      &#34;irrelevant&#34; files that we are not operating on, such as log
      files, temporary files, or external binary files.
    * As a corollary, we may only read from files passed to the
      ``read_text``, ``read_binary``, and ``declare_read`` methods.
      Again, this does not apply to &#34;irrelevant&#34; files.
    * Another corollary: We may only write to a (relevant) file during a
      call to ``build_file`` or ``build_file_with_comparison`` for that
      file.

    If these restrictions are followed, then the behavior of
    ``FileBuilder.build`` is equivalent to the following:

    * Remove all files created during the previous build.
    * Call the function passed as an argument to ``FileBuilder.build``.
    * Whenever we call ``build_file``, ``build_file_with_comparison``,
      or ``subbuild``, call the function passed as an argument.
    * If the function passed to ``FileBuilder.build`` doesn&#39;t raise an
      exception, return that function&#39;s return value.
    * If the function passed to ``FileBuilder.build`` raises an
      exception, roll back. That is, remove all of the files created
      during the current build, and restore all of the files written
      during the previous build.

    Even though this is what ``FileBuilder.build`` appears to be doing,
    this is not what actually happens behind the scenes. In reality,
    whenever we can use a previously cached result instead of calling a
    function passed as an argument to a ``FileBuilder`` method, we do
    so. Using a cached result is legitimate if the filename and function
    name are the same, the arguments to the function are the same, the
    optional version is the same, and all of the file system operations
    have the same results.

    In addition, to save time, ``FileBuilder`` doesn&#39;t initially delete
    any of the files written during the previous build. It&#39;s possible
    that many of these files won&#39;t need to be touched at all, because
    their cache entries are still valid. For this and other reasons, the
    results of ``FileBuilder``&#39;s file system methods, such as
    ``is_file`` and ``list_dir``, depend on the virtual state of the
    file system maintained by ``FileBuilder``, not simply on the real
    state of the file system.

    ``FileBuilder`` does its best to deal with concurrent external
    changes to files and directories, but it makes no guarantees.

    ``FileBuilder`` is thread-safe. A build process may be parallelized
    using multithreading or multiprocessing. However, be aware that the
    global interpreter lock affects the effectiveness of multithreading
    with regard to parallelism; see
    https://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock .
    &#34;&#34;&#34;

    # Implementation notes:
    #
    # Unless otherwise specified, apart from public FileBuilder methods, all
    # arguments, return values, and fields in the source code (excluding tests
    # and samples) must be &#34;sanitized&#34;:
    #
    # * All filenames must be sanitized, as in _sanitize_filename. (Depending
    #   on the use case, they may or not be &#34;norm-cased&#34;, i.e. the result of a
    #   call to os.path.normcase.)
    # * All JSON values must be sanitized, as in JsonUtil.sanitize, unless
    #   they represent return values of simple operations, in which case they
    #   may include tuples.
    #
    # The real state of the file system is the same as the virtual state of the
    # file system, except for the following:
    #
    # * Additional files and directories created during the previous build may
    #   be present, including the cache file.
    # * Files we are currently building may be present.
    # * Additional directories that were created during the current build (for
    #   build_file*), but need to be removed due to exceptions in build_file*
    #   functions may be present.
    # * Files and directories in the relevant instance of CreatedFiles may be
    #   absent.
    #
    # FileBuilder methods attempt to represent the true virtual state of the
    # file system, but they are not always correct. However, they are intended
    # to satisfy the following requirements:
    #
    # * Correctness: If there are no external modifications to the file system
    #   during the build, then in the single-threaded case, all simple
    #   operations should return the correct results. In the multi-threaded
    #   case, simple operations might return incorrect results, because they
    #   are not always atomic. However, once all previous modifications have
    #   settled, a simple operation should return the correct result, provided
    #   there are no concurrent modifications.
    # * Eventual consistency: If there are external modifications to the
    #   file system, then all simple operations should eventually be
    #   consistent. To be precise, once all previous modifications have
    #   settled, if a series of simple operations Q is executed twice with no
    #   intervening internal or external file changes, then the results of the
    #   second execution should be consistent with each other. Examples of
    #   inconsistent results would be claiming that a given filename is both a
    #   file and a directory, or claiming that a file exists but one of its
    #   parent directories does not. (The purpose of executing the operations
    #   twice is to give FileBuilder the chance to realize that certain files
    #   exist.)
    #
    # Private attributes:
    #
    # FileBackups _backups - The FileBackups instance we are using to back up
    #     output files from the previous build. This is shared across all
    #     FileBuilder instances for the current build.
    # BuildDirs _build_dirs - The BuildDirs instance for the current build.
    #     This is shared across all FileBuilder instances for the build.
    # bool _is_finished_build - Whether this is a FileBuilder instance for the
    #     root build function (i.e. _operation is None), and the root build
    #     function has finished executing.
    # Lock _lock - The lock guarding writes to _operation.suboperations.
    # Cache _new_cache - The Cache object storing the cached results for the
    #     current build. This is shared across all FileBuilder instances for
    #     the build. Note that we don&#39;t add created directories to _new_cache
    #     until we&#39;ve finished calling the function passed to build_versioned.
    #     It&#39;s easier to figure out which directories were created at the end
    #     of the build, considering how directories can be (virtually) created
    #     and removed concurrently.
    # Cache _old_cache - The Cache object storing the cached results from the
    #     previous build.
    # ComplexOperation _operation - The operation that this FileBuilder
    #     instance is responsible for executing. _operation is None if this is
    #     a FileBuilder instance for the root build function, i.e. there is no
    #     corresponding operation.
    # SimpleOperationExecutor _simple_operation_executor - The executor for
    #     executing simple operations, including operations that aren&#39;t
    #     recorded in _new_cache but are just part of the build process. This
    #     is shared across all FileBuilder instances for the build.

    # Whether the operating system is Windows

        This is equivalent to ``build_versioned(cache_filename,
        build_name, {}, func, *args, **kwargs)``. See the comments for
        ``build_versioned``.
        &#34;&#34;&#34;

    def build_versioned(
            cache_filename, build_name, versions, func, *args, **kwargs):
        &#34;&#34;&#34;Execute a build operation.

        The behavior of ``build_versioned`` is equivalent to the
        following:

        * Delete all of the files written during the previous build
          (even if some of them have changed), including
          ``cache_filename``. Remove all of the directories created
          during the last build that are empty.
        * Call ``func(builder, *args, **kwargs)``, where ``builder`` is
          a new instance of ``FileBuilder``.
        * If ``func`` doesn&#39;t raise an exception, commit: store
          all of the results from the current build in
          ``cache_filename``.
        * If ``func`` raises an exception, roll back. That is, delete
          all of the files and directories created during the current
          build, and restore all of the files and directories written
          during the previous build (even if they had changed) and the
          old contents of ``cache_filename``. Also, restore the old
          contents of any files that ``build_file*` overwrote.

        However, ``build_versioned`` doesn&#39;t literally follow the above
        steps. Instead, it uses cached results from the previous build
        whenever possible. These results are read from
        ``cache_filename``. (If the file doesn&#39;t exist, we assume this
        is the first build and the cache is empty.)

        Note that the result of ``func(builder, *args, **kwargs)`` is
        not cached; only ``build_file*`` and subbuild results are
        cached. If you wish to cache the call to ``func``, you should
        wrap it in a subbuild.

        ``func`` must perform all file system operations by calling
        methods on the ``FileBuilder``. However, unlike build file and
        subbuild functions, it need not be functional or deterministic.

        ``versions`` is a map from functions&#39; names to their versions. A
        function&#39;s &#34;version&#34; is an arbitrary JSON value describing its
        behavior. If you change a function&#39;s version, this invalidates
        all of its cache entries that were cached under a different
        version. It also invalidates the cache entries for the functions
        that called it, the functions that called the functions that
        called it, and so on. (If ``versions`` does not contain an entry
        for a given function, then its version is ``None``.)

        Here&#39;s a suggestion for how to use versions:

        * Initially, pass in ``{}`` for the versions.
        * Whenever you change a build file or subbuild function, say by
          improving its output or by fixing a bug, add a mapping from
          the function&#39;s name to the current timestamp. For example, you
          could use the output of the UNIX command
          ``date -u +&#34;%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ&#34;``.

        Arguments:
            cache_filename (pathlike): The file used to store cached
                results. This must be a string or ``bytes`` object or a
                path-like object (see
                https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-path-like-object
                ).
            build_name (str): A string identifying the build type. We
                raise an exception if this doesn&#39;t match the build name
                used when creating ``cache_filename``. The purpose of
                the build name is to ensure that we don&#39;t use a cache
                file created for a different build process.
            versions (dict): A map from functions&#39; names to their
                versions.
            func (callable): The function. This accepts a
                ``FileBuilder`` as an argument, followed by ``*args``
                and ``**kwargs``. The function must perform all file
                system operations by calling methods on the
                ``FileBuilder``.
            *args: The positional arguments to the function, apart from
                the ``FileBuilder``. (These need not be JSON values.)
            **kwargs: The keyword arguments to the function. (These need
                not be JSON values.)

        Returns:
            The return value of ``func``. (This need not be a JSON
            value.)

        Raises:
            TypeError: If one of the arguments has the wrong type.
            OSError: If there was an OS error reading or writing the
                cache file, moving or removing files or directories from
                the previous build, etc.
            Exception: If there was an error parsing the cache file,
                ``build_name`` doesn&#39;t match the build name used when
                creating ``cache_filename``, or ``func`` raised an

        all of the directories created during the last build that are
        empty. (If ``cache_filename`` doesn&#39;t exist, we assume there
        were no previous builds, and calling ``clean`` has no effect.)

        If the intent is to redo the build after changing its
        implementation, consider calling ``build_versioned`` with a
        suitable ``versions`` argument instead.

        Arguments:
            cache_filename (pathlike): The file storing the cached
                results from the previous build. This must be a string

                ).
            build_name (str): A string identifying the build type, as in

                may be ``None``, indicating that the build name is
                unknown.

        Raises:
            TypeError: If one of the arguments has the wrong type.
            OSError: If there was an OS error reading the cache file or
                removing the files or directories from the previous

    def build_file(self, filename, func_name, func, *args, **kwargs):
        &#34;&#34;&#34;Write the specified output file.

        This is equivalent to ``build_file_with_comparison(filename,
        FileComparison.METADATA, func_name, func, *args, **kwargs)``.
        See the comments for ``build_file_with_comparison``.
        &#34;&#34;&#34;
        return self.build_file_with_comparison(
            filename, FileComparison.METADATA, func_name, func, *args,
            **kwargs)

    def build_file_with_comparison(
            self, filename, file_comparison, func_name, func, *args, **kwargs):
        &#34;&#34;&#34;Write the specified output file.

        This is equivalent to calling ``func(builder, absolute_filename,
        *args, **kwargs)``, where ``builder`` is an instance of
        ``FileBuilder`` and ``absolute_filename`` is the absolute
        filename (i.e. the return value of
        ``os.path.abspath(os.fsdecode(filename))``). ``func`` must write
        to the given file - by calling ``open``, passing it as an
        argument to a shell command, or by some other means.

        If possible, we use the cached results from the previous build
        instead of calling ``func``; in other words, we retain the
        current contents of ``filename``.

        Before calling ``func``, ``build_file_with_comparison``
        automatically creates all of the parent directories of
        ``filename``, and it deletes the file if it is present. If
        ``func`` raises an exception, then
        ``build_file_with_comparison`` deletes ``filename`` if it is
        present, along with any parent directories it created if they
        are empty, and it re-raises the exception.

        Building a file is atomic. From the perspective of functions
        passed to ``FileBuilder``, the file isn&#39;t created until ``func``
        returns, at which point it receives its final contents. So until
        ``func`` returns, methods such as ``is_file`` and ``read_text``
        will act as though the file doesn&#39;t exist yet, even if it does.

        ``build_file``/``build_file_with_comparison`` may not be called
        twice on the same file in a single build. Calls to
        ``build_file*`` and ``subbuild`` may be nested within calls to
        ``build_file*``.

        The ``FileBuilder`` instance passed to ``func`` is not the same
        as ``self``. ``func`` must use the ``FileBuilder`` instance
        passed to it to perform all file system operations; it may not
        use ``self``.

        The arguments (``args`` and ``kwargs``) and the return value of
        ``func`` must be JSON values. ``FileBuilder`` copies and
        &#34;sanitizes&#34; these values, using
        ``json.loads(json.dumps(value))`` or something equivalent. (If
        we need to pass in an object that is not a JSON value, we can
        serialize it to a string first.)

        A note on concurrency: ``build_file_with_comparison`` must be
        called in the same process as the original call to ``build`` or
        ``build_versioned``. They need to share memory to communicate
        the cached results. In order to parallelize using
        multiprocessing, you should create a separate thread, call
        ``build_file*`` inside that thread, and spawn a new process
        inside of ``func``. (Make sure the new process doesn&#39;t call any
        ``FileBuilder`` methods.) See
        ``samples/parallel_seam_carving/parallel_seam_carve_builder.py``
        for an example.

        Sometimes it is desirable to pass arguments to ``func`` that
        don&#39;t affect the results, but are needed for coordinating
        parallelism or for some other allowable purpose. Examples
        include ``ThreadPoolExecutors`` and instances of
        ``multiprocessing.pool.Pool``. The problem with this is that the
        arguments passed to ``func`` are copies of ``args`` and
        ``kwargs``, rather than direct references. In such cases, we can
        smuggle in the arguments either by binding them using
        ``functools.partial``, or by making them fields of the some
        object (e.g. ``self._my_executor``) and passing in one of the
        object&#39;s methods for ``func`` (e.g. ``self._my_build_file``).

        Arguments:
            filename (pathlike): The file we are writing. This must be a
                string or ``bytes`` object or a path-like object (see
                https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-path-like-object
                ).
            file_comparison (FileComparison): The method to use to
                compare the output file. During the next build, we will
                use this comparison to check whether the output file has
                changed, in which case we must rebuild the file.
            func_name (str): A string identifying the function ``func``.
            func (callable): The function. This accepts a
                ``FileBuilder`` and the absolute filename as arguments,
                followed by ``*args`` and ``**kwargs``. The function
                must be functional and deterministic, and it must
                perform all file system operations by calling methods on
                the ``FileBuilder``.
            *args: The positional arguments to the function, apart from
                the ``FileBuilder`` and filename.
            **kwargs: The keyword arguments to the function.

        Returns:
            The (actual or cached) return value of ``func``.

        Raises:
            TypeError: If one of the arguments has the wrong type, or
                the return value of ``func`` is not a JSON value.
            OSError: If there was an OS error creating the parent
                directories, moving or removing files or directories
                from the previous build to make room for the file, etc.

    def subbuild(self, func_name, func, *args, **kwargs):
        &#34;&#34;&#34;Execute a cacheable operation.

        This is equivalent to calling ``func(builder, *args,
        **kwargs)``, except we don&#39;t call ``func`` if the result is
        cached. A typical use case would be to read a file, compute some
        information about its contents, and return the result. Calls to
        ``build_file*`` and ``subbuild`` may be nested within calls to
        ``subbuild``. ``subbuild`` may not be called twice with the same
        function name and arguments in a single build.

        How a build is divided into subbuilds has a significant effect
        on performance. A rule of thumb is that file reads should be
        divided into as many separate subbuilds and calls to
        ``build_file*`` as is possible (and practical). This assumes
        that the most time-consuming parts of the build process involve
        processing input files (i.e. reading from them and computing
        information about their contents) and generating output files.

        However, it&#39;s generally not a good idea for ``subbuild`` to read
        in a file and return its full contents. Then we would store the
        file&#39;s contents in the cache. This is likely a waste of space
        and time.

        It might be tempting to create deeply nested subbuilds, with the
        intention of increasing the opportunities for caching. However,
        this is not normally beneficial. For example, suppose we need to
        perform some time-consuming computation on each of the files in
        a given directory. Here, we would use a separate subbuild for
        each input file - so far so good. But we might also think to
        create a separate subbuild for each subdirectory, reasoning that
        if none of the files in a given directory have changed since the
        previous build, then we can save time by skipping over that
        directory. However, in order to determine whether we can use the
        cached results for a given directory, we&#39;d have to repeat all of
        the file system operations performed for that directory. In
        other words, we&#39;d have to recursively check all of the files in
        that directory to see whether they&#39;ve changed since the last
        build. But this behavior is really no faster than the baseline
        case, where we don&#39;t create a separate subbuild for each
        directory. This is not to say that deeply nested subbuilds are
        never beneficial, but just to point out the implications of
        nesting subbuilds.

        The ``FileBuilder`` instance passed to ``func`` is not the same
        as ``self``. ``func`` must use the ``FileBuilder`` instance
        passed to it to perform all file system operations; it may not
        use ``self``.

        The arguments (``args`` and ``kwargs``) and the return value of
        ``func`` must be JSON values. ``FileBuilder`` copies and
        &#34;sanitizes&#34; these values, using
        ``json.loads(json.dumps(value))`` or something equivalent. (If
        we need to pass in an object that is not a JSON value, we can
        serialize it to a string first.)

        A note on concurrency: ``subbuild`` must be called in the same
        process as the original call to ``build`` or
        ``build_versioned``. They need to share memory to communicate
        the cached results. In order to parallelize using
        multiprocessing, you should create a separate thread, call
        ``subbuild`` inside that thread, and spawn a new process inside
        of ``func``. (Make sure the new process doesn&#39;t call any
        ``FileBuilder`` methods.) See
        ``samples/parallel_seam_carving/parallel_seam_carve_builder.py``
        for an example.

        Sometimes it is desirable to pass arguments to ``func`` that
        don&#39;t affect the results, but are needed for coordinating
        parallelism or for some other allowable purpose. Examples
        include ``ThreadPoolExecutors`` and instances of
        ``multiprocessing.pool.Pool``. The problem with this is that the
        arguments passed to ``func`` are copies of ``args`` and
        ``kwargs``, rather than direct references. In such cases, we can
        smuggle in the arguments either by binding them using
        ``functools.partial``, or by making them fields of the some
        object (e.g. ``self._my_executor``) and passing in one of the
        object&#39;s methods for ``func`` (e.g. ``self._my_subbuild``).

        Arguments:
            func_name (str): A string identifying the function ``func``.
            func (callable): The function. This accepts a
                ``FileBuilder`` as an argument, followed by ``*args``
                and ``**kwargs``. The function must be functional and
                deterministic, and it must perform all file system
                operations by calling methods on the ``FileBuilder``.
            *args: The positional arguments to the function, apart from
                the ``FileBuilder``.
            **kwargs: The keyword arguments to the function.

        Returns:
            The (actual or cached) return value of ``func``.

        Raises:
            TypeError: If one of the arguments has the wrong type, or
                the return value of ``func`` is not a JSON value.

    def declare_read(self, filename, file_comparison=FileComparison.METADATA):
        &#34;&#34;&#34;Declare that we are reading the specified file.

        Each function passed to ``build``, ``build_versioned``,
        ``subbuild``, or ``build_file*`` must declare all of the
        (relevant) files that it reads, excluding those which it reads
        by calling ``read_text`` or ``read_binary``. While ``read_text``
        and ``read_binary`` are more explicit, it&#39;s not always practical
        to call them. For example, the read might occur in a third-party
        library or in a shell script.

        It is recommended to call ``declare_read`` before reading a
        file, not after. This ensures that we declare the file even if
        there is an exception when reading it. If this is not practical,
        we may call ``declare_read`` after reading the relevant files.
        However, to ensure correct behavior, if we fail to declare the
        files due to an exception, we must make sure that this exception
        (or some other exception) is raised all the way up through the
        function passed to ``build`` or ``build_versioned``.

        Arguments:
            filename (pathlike): The file to read. This must be a string
                or ``bytes`` object or a path-like object (see
                https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-path-like-object
                ).
            file_comparison (FileComparison): The method to use to

                which case the cache entries containing the call to

    def list_dir(self, dir_):
        &#34;&#34;&#34;Return the subfiles of the specified directory.

        Return the subfiles of the specified directory, according to the
        virtual state of the file system. This is a list of the names of
        the files and directories that are direct children of the
        directory, in an arbitrary order. The names only contain the
        final components of each path, e.g. ``&#39;bar&#39;`` and not
        ``&#39;/foo/bar&#39;``. The return value does not include special
        entries like ``&#39;.&#39;`` and ``&#39;..&#39;``.

        This is almost an analogue of ``os.listdir(dir_)``. The
        difference is that the return value always contains strings
        rather than ``bytes`` objects, and ``FileBuilder.list_dir``
        doesn&#39;t handle file descriptors.

        Arguments:
            dir_ (pathlike): The directory. This must be a string or
                ``bytes`` object or a path-like object (see
                https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-path-like-object

    def walk(self, dir_, top_down=True):
        &#34;&#34;&#34;Return the files in the specified directory, recursively.

        Return a list describing the files in the specified directory,
        according to the virtual state of the file system. This includes
        not just the immediate children, but all descendant files.
        However, it does not include descendants of directories other
        than ``dir_`` that are symbolic links. This returns ``[]`` if in
        the virtual state of the file system, the file does not exist or
        the filename refers to a regular file.

        The return value is a list of tuples (dir_name, subdirs,
        subfiles), each of which describes the immediate children of one
        directory. There is one tuple for each subdirectory of ``dir_``,
        including one tuple for ``dir_``. The first element of each
        tuple is the absolute filename for the subdirectory. The second
        element is a list of the names of its immediate subdirectories.
        The third element is a list of the names of its immediate
        subfiles, excluding directories.

        The names only contain the final components of each path, e.g.
        ``&#39;bar&#39;`` and not ``&#39;/foo/bar&#39;``. They do not include special
        entries like ``&#39;.&#39;`` and ``&#39;..&#39;``. Each list of names is in an
        arbitrary order.

        If ``top_down`` is true, then the tuple for a directory appears
        before the tuples for the directories it contains. Otherwise, it
        appears after. Apart from this constraint, the order of the
        tuples is unspecified.

        This is a loose analogue of ``os.walk(dir_, top_down)``, but
        there are some significant differences.

        Arguments:
            dir_ (pathlike): The directory. This must be a string or

            top_down (bool): Whether to return the contents of each
                directory before those of its subdirectories.

        This follows symbolic links. This is the analogue of

        Return whether the specified filename refers to an existing file
        or directory, according to the virtual state of the file system.
        This returns ``False`` if the file is a broken symbolic link.
        Depending on the operating system, it may return ``False`` if we
        don&#39;t have permission to check the file.

        This is almost an analogue of ``os.path.exists(filename)``. The
        difference is that ``FileBuilder.exists`` doesn&#39;t handle file
        descriptors.

        Arguments:

def build_versioned(
        cache_filename, build_name, versions, func, *args, **kwargs):
    &#34;&#34;&#34;Execute a build operation.

    The behavior of ``build_versioned`` is equivalent to the
    following:

    * Delete all of the files written during the previous build
      (even if some of them have changed), including
      ``cache_filename``. Remove all of the directories created
      during the last build that are empty.
    * Call ``func(builder, *args, **kwargs)``, where ``builder`` is
      a new instance of ``FileBuilder``.
    * If ``func`` doesn&#39;t raise an exception, commit: store
      all of the results from the current build in
      ``cache_filename``.
    * If ``func`` raises an exception, roll back. That is, delete
      all of the files and directories created during the current
      build, and restore all of the files and directories written
      during the previous build (even if they had changed) and the
      old contents of ``cache_filename``. Also, restore the old
      contents of any files that ``build_file*` overwrote.

    However, ``build_versioned`` doesn&#39;t literally follow the above
    steps. Instead, it uses cached results from the previous build
    whenever possible. These results are read from
    ``cache_filename``. (If the file doesn&#39;t exist, we assume this
    is the first build and the cache is empty.)

    Note that the result of ``func(builder, *args, **kwargs)`` is
    not cached; only ``build_file*`` and subbuild results are
    cached. If you wish to cache the call to ``func``, you should
    wrap it in a subbuild.

    ``func`` must perform all file system operations by calling
    methods on the ``FileBuilder``. However, unlike build file and
    subbuild functions, it need not be functional or deterministic.

    ``versions`` is a map from functions&#39; names to their versions. A
    function&#39;s &#34;version&#34; is an arbitrary JSON value describing its
    behavior. If you change a function&#39;s version, this invalidates
    all of its cache entries that were cached under a different
    version. It also invalidates the cache entries for the functions
    that called it, the functions that called the functions that
    called it, and so on. (If ``versions`` does not contain an entry
    for a given function, then its version is ``None``.)

    Here&#39;s a suggestion for how to use versions:

    * Initially, pass in ``{}`` for the versions.
    * Whenever you change a build file or subbuild function, say by
      improving its output or by fixing a bug, add a mapping from
      the function&#39;s name to the current timestamp. For example, you
      could use the output of the UNIX command
      ``date -u +&#34;%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ&#34;``.

    Arguments:
        cache_filename (pathlike): The file used to store cached
            results. This must be a string or ``bytes`` object or a
            path-like object (see
            https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-path-like-object
            ).
        build_name (str): A string identifying the build type. We
            raise an exception if this doesn&#39;t match the build name
            used when creating ``cache_filename``. The purpose of
            the build name is to ensure that we don&#39;t use a cache
            file created for a different build process.
        versions (dict): A map from functions&#39; names to their
            versions.
        func (callable): The function. This accepts a
            ``FileBuilder`` as an argument, followed by ``*args``
            and ``**kwargs``. The function must perform all file
            system operations by calling methods on the
            ``FileBuilder``.
        *args: The positional arguments to the function, apart from
            the ``FileBuilder``. (These need not be JSON values.)
        **kwargs: The keyword arguments to the function. (These need
            not be JSON values.)

    Returns:
        The return value of ``func``. (This need not be a JSON
        value.)

    Raises:
        TypeError: If one of the arguments has the wrong type.
        OSError: If there was an OS error reading or writing the
            cache file, moving or removing files or directories from
            the previous build, etc.

    empty. (If ``cache_filename`` doesn&#39;t exist, we assume there
    were no previous builds, and calling ``clean`` has no effect.)

    If the intent is to redo the build after changing its
    implementation, consider calling ``build_versioned`` with a
    suitable ``versions`` argument instead.

    Arguments:
        cache_filename (pathlike): The file storing the cached
            results from the previous build. This must be a string
            or ``bytes`` object or a path-like object (see
            https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-path-like-object
            ).
        build_name (str): A string identifying the build type, as in
            the ``build_name`` argument to ``build_versioned``. This
            may be ``None``, indicating that the build name is
            unknown.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If one of the arguments has the wrong type.
        OSError: If there was an OS error reading the cache file or
            removing the files or directories from the previous
            build.
        Exception: If there was an error parsing the cache file,
            or ``build_name`` isn&#39;t ``None`` and it doesn&#39;t match
            the build name used when creating ``cache_filename``.
    &#34;&#34;&#34;
    if build_name is not None and not isinstance(build_name, str):
        raise TypeError(&#39;Build name must be a string&#39;)

<p>This is equivalent to calling <code>func(builder, absolute_filename,

filename (i.e. the return value of

<p>If possible, we use the cached results from the previous build

<p>Before calling <code>func</code>, <code>build_file_with_comparison</code>
automatically creates all of the parent directories of

<code>func</code> raises an exception, then
<code>build_file_with_comparison</code> deletes <code>filename</code> if it is
present, along with any parent directories it created if they
are empty, and it re-raises the exception.</p>
<p>Building a file is atomic. From the perspective of functions
passed to <code>FileBuilder</code>, the file isn't created until <code>func</code>
returns, at which point it receives its final contents. So until
<code>func</code> returns, methods such as <code>is_file</code> and <code>read_text</code>
will act as though the file doesn't exist yet, even if it does.</p>
<p><code>build_file</code>/<code>build_file_with_comparison</code> may not be called

<p>The <code>FileBuilder</code> instance passed to <code>func</code> is not the same

<p>The arguments (<code>args</code> and <code>kwargs</code>) and the return value of

we need to pass in an object that is not a JSON value, we can
serialize it to a string first.)</p>
<p>A note on concurrency: <code>build_file_with_comparison</code> must be
called in the same process as the original call to <code>build</code> or
<code>build_versioned</code>. They need to share memory to communicate
the cached results. In order to parallelize using
multiprocessing, you should create a separate thread, call
<code>build_file*</code> inside that thread, and spawn a new process
inside of <code>func</code>. (Make sure the new process doesn't call any
<code>FileBuilder</code> methods.) See
<code>samples/parallel_seam_carving/parallel_seam_carve_builder.py</code>
for an example.</p>
<p>Sometimes it is desirable to pass arguments to <code>func</code> that

smuggle in the arguments either by binding them using

    This is equivalent to calling ``func(builder, absolute_filename,

    Before calling ``func``, ``build_file_with_comparison``

        file_comparison (FileComparison): The method to use to
            compare the output file. During the next build, we will
            use this comparison to check whether the output file has
            changed, in which case we must rebuild the file.

</code></dt>
<dd>
<section class="desc"><p>Execute a cacheable operation.</p>
<p>This is equivalent to calling <code>func(builder, *args,
**kwargs)</code>, except we don't call <code>func</code> if the result is
cached. A typical use case would be to read a file, compute some
information about its contents, and return the result. Calls to
<code>build_file*</code> and <code>subbuild</code> may be nested within calls to
<code>subbuild</code>. <code>subbuild</code> may not be called twice with the same
function name and arguments in a single build.</p>
<p>How a build is divided into subbuilds has a significant effect
on performance. A rule of thumb is that file reads should be
divided into as many separate subbuilds and calls to
<code>build_file*</code> as is possible (and practical). This assumes
that the most time-consuming parts of the build process involve
processing input files (i.e. reading from them and computing
information about their contents) and generating output files.</p>
<p>However, it's generally not a good idea for <code>subbuild</code> to read
in a file and return its full contents. Then we would store the
file's contents in the cache. This is likely a waste of space
and time.</p>
<p>It might be tempting to create deeply nested subbuilds, with the
intention of increasing the opportunities for caching. However,
this is not normally beneficial. For example, suppose we need to
perform some time-consuming computation on each of the files in
a given directory. Here, we would use a separate subbuild for
each input file - so far so good. But we might also think to
create a separate subbuild for each subdirectory, reasoning that
if none of the files in a given directory have changed since the
previous build, then we can save time by skipping over that
directory. However, in order to determine whether we can use the
cached results for a given directory, we'd have to repeat all of
the file system operations performed for that directory. In
other words, we'd have to recursively check all of the files in
that directory to see whether they've changed since the last
build. But this behavior is really no faster than the baseline
case, where we don't create a separate subbuild for each
directory. This is not to say that deeply nested subbuilds are
never beneficial, but just to point out the implications of
nesting subbuilds.</p>
<p>The <code>FileBuilder</code> instance passed to <code>func</code> is not the same
as <code>self</code>. <code>func</code> must use the <code>FileBuilder</code> instance
passed to it to perform all file system operations; it may not
use <code>self</code>.</p>
<p>The arguments (<code>args</code> and <code>kwargs</code>) and the return value of
<code>func</code> must be JSON values. <code>FileBuilder</code> copies and
"sanitizes" these values, using
<code>json.loads(json.dumps(value))</code> or something equivalent. (If
we need to pass in an object that is not a JSON value, we can
serialize it to a string first.)</p>
<p>A note on concurrency: <code>subbuild</code> must be called in the same
process as the original call to <code>build</code> or
<code>build_versioned</code>. They need to share memory to communicate
the cached results. In order to parallelize using
multiprocessing, you should create a separate thread, call
<code>subbuild</code> inside that thread, and spawn a new process inside
of <code>func</code>. (Make sure the new process doesn't call any
<code>FileBuilder</code> methods.) See
<code>samples/parallel_seam_carving/parallel_seam_carve_builder.py</code>
for an example.</p>
<p>Sometimes it is desirable to pass arguments to <code>func</code> that
don't affect the results, but are needed for coordinating
parallelism or for some other allowable purpose. Examples
include <code>ThreadPoolExecutors</code> and instances of
<code>multiprocessing.pool.Pool</code>. The problem with this is that the
arguments passed to <code>func</code> are copies of <code>args</code> and
<code>kwargs</code>, rather than direct references. In such cases, we can
smuggle in the arguments either by binding them using
<code>functools.partial</code>, or by making them fields of the some
object (e.g. <code>self._my_executor</code>) and passing in one of the
object's methods for <code>func</code> (e.g. <code>self._my_subbuild</code>).</p>

<pre><code class="python">def subbuild(self, func_name, func, *args, **kwargs):
    &#34;&#34;&#34;Execute a cacheable operation.

    This is equivalent to calling ``func(builder, *args,
    **kwargs)``, except we don&#39;t call ``func`` if the result is
    cached. A typical use case would be to read a file, compute some
    information about its contents, and return the result. Calls to
    ``build_file*`` and ``subbuild`` may be nested within calls to
    ``subbuild``. ``subbuild`` may not be called twice with the same
    function name and arguments in a single build.

    How a build is divided into subbuilds has a significant effect
    on performance. A rule of thumb is that file reads should be
    divided into as many separate subbuilds and calls to
    ``build_file*`` as is possible (and practical). This assumes
    that the most time-consuming parts of the build process involve
    processing input files (i.e. reading from them and computing
    information about their contents) and generating output files.

    However, it&#39;s generally not a good idea for ``subbuild`` to read
    in a file and return its full contents. Then we would store the
    file&#39;s contents in the cache. This is likely a waste of space
    and time.

    It might be tempting to create deeply nested subbuilds, with the
    intention of increasing the opportunities for caching. However,
    this is not normally beneficial. For example, suppose we need to
    perform some time-consuming computation on each of the files in
    a given directory. Here, we would use a separate subbuild for
    each input file - so far so good. But we might also think to
    create a separate subbuild for each subdirectory, reasoning that
    if none of the files in a given directory have changed since the
    previous build, then we can save time by skipping over that
    directory. However, in order to determine whether we can use the
    cached results for a given directory, we&#39;d have to repeat all of
    the file system operations performed for that directory. In
    other words, we&#39;d have to recursively check all of the files in
    that directory to see whether they&#39;ve changed since the last
    build. But this behavior is really no faster than the baseline
    case, where we don&#39;t create a separate subbuild for each
    directory. This is not to say that deeply nested subbuilds are
    never beneficial, but just to point out the implications of
    nesting subbuilds.

    The ``FileBuilder`` instance passed to ``func`` is not the same
    as ``self``. ``func`` must use the ``FileBuilder`` instance
    passed to it to perform all file system operations; it may not
    use ``self``.

    The arguments (``args`` and ``kwargs``) and the return value of
    ``func`` must be JSON values. ``FileBuilder`` copies and
    &#34;sanitizes&#34; these values, using
    ``json.loads(json.dumps(value))`` or something equivalent. (If
    we need to pass in an object that is not a JSON value, we can
    serialize it to a string first.)

    A note on concurrency: ``subbuild`` must be called in the same
    process as the original call to ``build`` or
    ``build_versioned``. They need to share memory to communicate
    the cached results. In order to parallelize using
    multiprocessing, you should create a separate thread, call
    ``subbuild`` inside that thread, and spawn a new process inside
    of ``func``. (Make sure the new process doesn&#39;t call any
    ``FileBuilder`` methods.) See
    ``samples/parallel_seam_carving/parallel_seam_carve_builder.py``
    for an example.

    Sometimes it is desirable to pass arguments to ``func`` that
    don&#39;t affect the results, but are needed for coordinating
    parallelism or for some other allowable purpose. Examples
    include ``ThreadPoolExecutors`` and instances of
    ``multiprocessing.pool.Pool``. The problem with this is that the
    arguments passed to ``func`` are copies of ``args`` and
    ``kwargs``, rather than direct references. In such cases, we can
    smuggle in the arguments either by binding them using
    ``functools.partial``, or by making them fields of the some
    object (e.g. ``self._my_executor``) and passing in one of the
    object&#39;s methods for ``func`` (e.g. ``self._my_subbuild``).

    Arguments:
        func_name (str): A string identifying the function ``func``.
        func (callable): The function. This accepts a
            ``FileBuilder`` as an argument, followed by ``*args``
            and ``**kwargs``. The function must be functional and
            deterministic, and it must perform all file system
            operations by calling methods on the ``FileBuilder``.
        *args: The positional arguments to the function, apart from
            the ``FileBuilder``.
        **kwargs: The keyword arguments to the function.

    Returns:
        The (actual or cached) return value of ``func``.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If one of the arguments has the wrong type, or
            the return value of ``func`` is not a JSON value.
        Exception: If we have already called ``subbuild`` with the
            same function name and arguments during this build; this
            ``FileBuilder`` instance has finished executing the
            relevant call to ``build_file*``, ``subbuild``,
